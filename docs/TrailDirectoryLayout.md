NOTE: It is best to use a Markdown editor/viewer for this file, I like MarkText

* For each trail in the current trails directory on the web server `E:\trails`

* Each directory has the name of the trail in the `CamelCase` style

* In the `E:\trails` directory, there is a file called `data.json` which contains all the base data for all images and is downloaded during initialization of the web trail viewer. This would need to be regenerated anytime there are changes to any of the trails using the `tools/process_data.py` script

* Inside of each trail folder there are these folders...

| `img`               | contains image tiles                                          | Each image tile generated has a folder and corresponding json file with the same randomly generated UUID name. The folder contains the image tiles and the json files contains metadata about the original image file. This is generated using the `tools/process_imgs.py` script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `img_blur`          | contains copies of the original images but with blurred faces | These are generated using the `tools/blur360/build/src/equirect-blur-image.exe` program. Look for `docs/BuildBlur360.md` for notes on how to build from source if the `exe` is not there. NOTE: The blurred images do not contain the necessary metadata about the image such as geolocation and capture date, thus it is necessary to always keep the original unblurred images in `img_original`!! NOTE: You can however delete the `img_blur` folder if you want after image tiles are done to save space |
| `img_original`      | contains the original images uploaded to the server           | This should be added using the web interface at `/admin/import_trail.php` NOTE: It is always important to keep the original images even after all processing is done just in case something needs to be reprocessed, it is not worth the extra saved hard drive space to delete them when you might need them later!!                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `sequence_new.json` | contains base data for all images in the trail                | Will be used in the `data.json` creation process                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

* NOTE: Many of these files are manipulated with scripts and so if manual intervention is ever needed it is important to always run scripts as `Administrator` otherwise if they are created by a normal user then the automated scripts will not be able to manipulate them in the future!
